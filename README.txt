# Simple Circle Fitter
### Two free, simple and fully self contained 
Circle Radius and Center Locating Scripts.

I composed these two scripts in Unity c# and am sharing them as CC-Zero.
It would be a very kind gesture if you did however leave some attribution somewhere near the fitting functions if you copy them, such as:

//Credits: Grant Olsen - 2018

Or just leave the credit in the original file if you use that, however it is not a requirement.

_An example and tutorial video on how to use the tool:_

Note that it is known that with any circle you must specify at least three coordinates in order to define it, and axiomatically, an infinite number of circles can be defined by trying to use two or less coordinates. Thus it is a requirement for these scripts to function that you always have 3 or more coordinates in available in the arrays!
